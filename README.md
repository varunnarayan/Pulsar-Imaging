# Pulsar-Imaging
This project aims to create images of pulsars in the radio, infrared, and visible wavelengths based on user RA and DEC input. 
If an anomaly in the timing of a pulsar is noticed, this program can be used to cross reference the discrepancy in the data. Based on the images generated by this program one can identify potential causes of erratic behaviour regarding the pulsar. 

This program currently supports cutouts from VLASS, 2MASS, SDSS and Pan-STARRS (in the case that SDSS does not cover the requested RA and DEC). 

TODO:  
Add a marker for pulsar on jpegs (SDSS, PS)   
Ra and dec on jpegs doesnt work   
Size of image flawed-no universal instance variable  
Scaling off  
Code sometimes hangs in case of position not found in a survey- needs more error handling   
If the vlass image is split between two frames i.e with the crab nebula, it will crash. The image size needs to be changed in that case.  
Wrong/incomplete fits files returned in certain cases
