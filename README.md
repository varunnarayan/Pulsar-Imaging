# Pulsar-Imaging
This project aims to create images of pulsars in the radio, infrared, and visible wavelengths based on user RA and DEC input. 
If an anomaly in the timing of a pulsar is noticed, this program can be used to cross reference the discrepancy in the data. Based on the images generated by this program one can identify potential causes of erratic behaviour regarding the pulsar. 

This program currently supports cutouts from VLASS, 2MASS, SDSS and Pan-STARRS (in the case that SDSS does not cover the requested RA and DEC). 

TODO:  
add marker for pulsar on jpegs (SDSS, PS)   
ra and dec on jpegs doesnt work   
size of image flawed-no universal instance variable  
scaling off  
code sometimes just hangs or stops working for no apparent reason   
if vlass image is split between two frames i.e crab nebula, will crash. need to change size in that case  
wrong/incomplete fits files returned in certain cases  

TEXTFILE FORMAT  
ra(00h00m00s) dec(00d00m00s) name vlass 2mass sdss  
ex:18h53m57.318305s +13d03m44.05085s J1853+1303 vlass 2mass sdss
