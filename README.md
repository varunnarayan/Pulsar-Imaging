# Pulsar-Imaging
This project aims to create images of pulsars in the radio, infrared, and visible wavelengths based on user RA and DEC input. 
If an anomaly in the timing of a pulsar is noticed, this program can be used to cross reference the discrepancy in the data. Based on the images generated by this program one can identify potential causes of erratic behaviour regarding the pulsar.
